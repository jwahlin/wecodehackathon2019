# WE CODE 2019 Team 1 - Volunteer intake for IRCO

# About our team

We are Sheila, Colleen, Tonja, Jamie and Becca

# About our app

The brainchild for our project was from one of our team member's attempts to enroll as a volunteer in the existing Volunteer site - (https://irco.org/support/volunteer.html)

We built this project from baseline of the WeCode starter pack (https://github.com/wecodehackathon/kickstart-js). Please refer to the kickstart.js details for the prerequisites and install instructions.




Some file basics:

- App.js: app logic
- App.css: app styling
- ListItem.js: a smart React component (includes state)
- ListItem.css: the styling for this React component
