# WE CODE 2019 Team 1 - Volunteer intake for IRCO

# About our team

We are Sheila, Colleen, Tonja, Jamie and Becca

# About our app

The brainchild for our project was from one of our team member's attempts to enroll as a volunteer in the existing Volunteer site - (https://irco.org/support/volunteer.html)

We built this project from baseline of the WeCode starter pack (https://github.com/wecodehackathon/kickstart-js). 

Please refer to the kickstart.js details for the prerequisites and install instructions.  Our hackathon work involved adding new functions to the existing base kit for new functionality

We started with designing two Google forms:

1) Google form for the IRCO administrators to detail available volunteer opportunities -

2) Google form for the volunteers to enter basic information about their interests and availability:
